# Project Stage 2:
Here we are going to add two repos into our packages folder.
We are going to use monorepo pattern but there are going to be multiple repos

We are going to add
i) electron-excel-tally
ii) excel-table-min

## Add the react-excel-tally repo
cd packages/apps
git clone ssh://git@github.com/neeraj76/react-excel-tally
cd react-excel-tally
rm *.lock
npm install

# We can see that node_modules is not created
npm start

The react repo is working !

cd ../../
git submodule add ssh://git@github.com/neeraj76/react-excel-tally


## Add the electron-excel-tally repo
# This time we will try a different approach which takes less commands to add submodule
git submodule add ssh://git@github.com/neeraj76/electron-excel-tally packages/apps/electron-excel-tally
cd packages/apps/electron-excel-tally

lerna add @glassball/tally --scope=electron-excel-tally

Stage 2 is complete.
We have successfully added the excel-table-min into react-excel-min.
We have used the monorepo pattern with multiple repos :)
This works and has an advantage that our project can be used in multiple repos.
